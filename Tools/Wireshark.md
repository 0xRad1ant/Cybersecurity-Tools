- **Promiscuous Mode:** It can put network interfaces into promiscuous mode, allowing the analysis of all traffic visible on the interface.
- **Graphical Interface:** Wireshark boasts a user-friendly graphical interface, making it accessible to both beginners and experts.
- **Filtering:** The tool enables complex filtering, allowing users to focus on specific types of packets or activities.
- **Protocols:** Wireshark supports a wide array of networking protocols, making it versatile for various network analysis needs.
- **Live and Offline Analysis:** Capture data live from networks or analyze packets from existing files.
- **Extensions:** Wireshark supports plugins, enabling the dissection of new and custom protocols.
- **VoIP and USB Support:** Detect and analyze Voice over IP (VoIP) calls, as well as capture raw USB traffic.

## History

Wireshark, initially called Ethereal, was created by Gerald Combs in the late 1990s. It was born out of the need for an affordable protocol analysis tool compatible with the company's primary platforms, Solaris and Linux. Renamed Wireshark in 2006, the project has been continuously developed and maintained by a vast community of contributors.

## Features

- **Live Capture:** Capture real-time data from various network types, including Ethernet, IEEE 802.11, PPP, and loopback.
- **File Analysis:** Analyze pre-captured data from network traces.
- **Display Filters:** Refine data display using powerful filters to focus on specific information.
- **Protocol Parsing:** Wireshark understands the structure of different networking protocols, parsing and displaying fields and meanings as specified by these protocols.
- **Plugin Support:** Extend Wireshark's functionality by creating custom plugins for dissecting new protocols.
- **VoIP Detection:** Detect and analyze Voice over IP (VoIP) calls within captured traffic.
- **USB Traffic Capture:** Capture raw USB traffic for in-depth analysis.

## Awards and Recognition

Wireshark has received numerous industry awards, including recognition from eWeek, InfoWorld, and PC Magazine. It has consistently ranked as a top-rated packet sniffer in network security tools surveys and was the SourceForge Project of the Month in August 2010.
