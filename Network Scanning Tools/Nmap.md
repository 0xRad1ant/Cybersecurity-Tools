# Network Scanning Tools: Nmap

## Introduction

Nmap stands as a free, open-source network scanner tool renowned for its versatility in supporting various scan types and protocols. It enables users to explore network topologies, discover hosts, and analyze network services.

### Nmap Features

- Supports multiple scan types: TCP, UDP, SYN, and more.
- Provides comprehensive information about network services and hosts.

## Npcap: Enhancing Nmap's Capabilities

Npcap, a critical component of the Nmap Project, enriches the functionality of Nmap, especially on Windows systems. It is a packet capture and sending library designed specifically for Microsoft Windows. Npcap implementation integrates the open Pcap API with a custom Windows kernel driver, providing a seamless experience for capturing and sending raw network traffic across various interfaces.

### Key Features of Npcap

1. **Loopback Packet Capture and Injection:**
   - Enables the capture of loopback packets, facilitating the monitoring of transmissions between services on the same machine.
   - Packet injection capabilities using the `pcap_inject()` function.
  
2. **Support for Current Windows Releases:**
   - Compatible with all Windows versions officially supported by Microsoft.
   - Utilizes NDIS 6 Light-Weight Filter (LWF) API for improved performance over the deprecated NDIS 5 API used by WinPcap.
  
3. **Libpcap API Integration:**
   - Leverages the latest Libpcap library, ensuring compatibility with Linux and MacOS systems.

4. **Support for All Windows Architectures:**
   - Compatibility across x86, x86-64, and ARM architectures, including the new Windows on ARM architecture.

5. **Enhanced Security Measures:**
   - Optional restriction for packet sniffing to only Administrator access, enhancing security.
   - Implementation of Windows ASLR and DEP security features.
  
6. **WinPcap Compatibility:**
   - Provides source-code compatibility with WinPcap, enhancing performance, compatibility, and security.
   - Suggests minor changes when porting legacy WinPcap software to Npcap for optimal utilization.

7. **Raw 802.11 Wireless Capture:**
   - Configurable to capture raw 802.11 traffic, including radiotap header details, supported directly by Wireshark.
